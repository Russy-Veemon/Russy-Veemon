### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Russy-Veemon/Russy-Veemon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a self-taught Software Engineer who fell in love with coding! I enjoy learning new technologies. I came from a non-traditional background. I studied Kinesiology at CSUN, and worked in the healthcare industry as a Physical Therapist Aide, then licensed PTA for a decade, helping a varied population of people reach their health and wellness goals. I have experience in business and customer service. 

I have always had an interest in computer science growing up as an avid gamer. My curiosity peaked with the rise of WEB3 in the past years. This led me to research more about programming to better understand how everything software worked. I attempted to learn how to code on my own, utilizing FreeCodeCamp.com, but found myself struggling to truly grasp the concepts.

After struggling on my own for 6 months, I decided to join Coding Dojo bootcamp to gain the opportunity to work on dev teams, collaborate with others, to help other students, and ultimately gain structure to my learning. I learned 1 full stack within 3 months (Python) and built many projects using different technologies.

SKILL SETS

FRONT END: Bootstrap
